# Project info
This assignment was done using the deep learning library Keras and Python3.
I trained the model on the FloydHub machine learning service/platform.

Running train_and_eval.py traines and evaluates the model. The model is fully
contained in the file and function create_model.py.

Output from FloydHub can be found in the folder output. The saved model is also
contained in that folder.

Running the script load_and_eval.py loads the model from the output folder and
evaluates it on the dataset.
